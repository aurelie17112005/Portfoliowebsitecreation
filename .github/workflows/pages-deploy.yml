# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
#
# This workflow builds the project and deploys the output to GitHub Pages.
# It uses actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1 (preferred) to upload the build directory.
#
# BUILD OUTPUT PATH:
# By default, this workflow uses ./dist as the build output path.
# If your project uses a different build directory (e.g., ./build, ./out),
# update the 'path' parameter in the "Upload pages artifact" step below.
# For Vite projects, check the 'outDir' setting in vite.config.ts.
# For Create React App, the default output is ./build.
